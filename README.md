# REQUIREMENTS TO RUN THE PROJECT

### 1. Python Installation
- Before starting the project, ensure you have Python installed.  
  You can download the latest version (3.8 or your preferred version) from the official Python website:  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Required Python Libraries
- You will need the following Python libraries for data handling, model building, and visualization. Install them using pip:
  - **Pandas** – For data manipulation and loading the dataset:  
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
  - **NumPy** – For numerical operations and array handling:  
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```
  - **Scikit-Learn** – For preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics:  
    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn
    ```
  - **TensorFlow/Keras** – For building and training the LSTM model:  
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    ```
  - **Keras-Tuner** – For hyperparameter tuning with Keras models:  
    ```bash
    pip install keras-tuner
    ```

### 3. Visualization and Plotting Libraries
- To visualize the data and model results, install the following libraries:
  - **Matplotlib** – For basic plots and visualizations:  
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
  - **Plotly** – For interactive visualizations (if needed):  
    ```bash
    pip install plotly
    ```

### 4. Streamlit for Web Interface
- **Streamlit** is used to create an interactive user interface for this project. Install it using:  
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
